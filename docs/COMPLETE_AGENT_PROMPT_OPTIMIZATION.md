## Meta-Cognitive Layer - All Agents

Every agent now includes explicit meta-cognitive questioning:

**Common Questions Across All**:
1. How objective am I really being?
2. What's my biggest blind spot?
3. Where would skeptics push back hardest?
4. What would change my mind?
5. How certain am I about this assessment?

**Agent-Specific Questions**:

**Market Analyst**:
- Context Verification (5 factors)
- Signal reliability assessment
- Certainty level calibration

**News Analyst**:
- Narrative stage identification
- Emotion peak detection
- Risk escalation protocols

**Fundamentals Analyst**:
- Cost structure sustainability
- Competitive signal calibration
- Dual-model scoring validation

**Bull Researcher**:
- Assumption chain completeness
- Synthetic probability realism
- Management credibility check

**Bear Researcher**:
- Skepticism fairness check
- Evidence-based recalibration
- Bias acknowledgment
