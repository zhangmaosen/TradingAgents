# üìä Before & After: How Prompts Changed

## The Problem We Solved

**Before:** Prompts had explicit frameworks but **no self-awareness**
- Rules applied rigidly
- No flexibility for edge cases
- Hidden assumptions
- Agents didn't know why they were scoring what they scored

**After:** Prompts have **frameworks + meta-cognitive layer**
- Rules are guidelines, not laws
- Encourages questioning assumptions
- Assumptions made explicit
- Agents explain their reasoning and acknowledge uncertainty

---

## Example 1: Market Analyst

### BEFORE (Old Approach)
```
"Select up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights..."
‚Üí Agent analyzes indicators
‚Üí Outputs technical conclusion

Problem: What if the signal is real but at 52-week high?
         What if whole industry is crashing?
         The framework has no answer.
```

### AFTER (New Approach with Context Verification)
```
Step 1: Analyze indicators (same as before)
Step 2: CHECK CONTEXT
        - Is company in growth or decline stage?
        - How far from 200-day average?
        - Is competition collapsing or strengthening?
        - Are fundamentals improving or deteriorating?
        
Step 3: ADJUST SCORE
        Signal + Positive context = Trust it more
        Signal + Negative context = Trust it less
        
Step 4: META-COGNITIVE CHECK
        "What's my biggest assumption?"
        "If I'm wrong, where would I fail?"
        "Am I 30% or 90% certain?"
        
Output: Signal Reliability Score: 6/10
        Certainty: 60%
        Biggest risk: Competitor price war
```

**Result:** Signals are now contextualized and the agent explains its thinking.

## Example 2: News Analyst

### BEFORE (Old Approach)
```
Analyze news ‚Üí Calculate sentiment ‚Üí Output sentiment score

Problem: Didn't distinguish between:
- FOMO peak (short-term reversal likely)
- Genuine narrative emergence (long-term opportunity)
- New normal (sentiment won't reverse)
```

### AFTER (New Approach with Peak Detection)
```
Step 1: Analyze news (same)
Step 2: IDENTIFY LIFECYCLE STAGE
        Early-stage narrative? Growth? Peak? Decay? Bottom?
        
Step 3: PEAK DETECTION (6 conditions)
        ‚úì News volume at historical high?
        ‚úì Social media 85%+ bullish?
        ‚úì Extreme language ("game-changing")?
        ‚úì Price new high + 20% gains?
        ‚úì Price targets 100%+ upside?
        ‚úì Retail participation exploding?
        
        3+ met = Peak warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
        
Step 4: META-COGNITIVE CHECK
        "Is this peak permanent or temporary?"
        "Historical precedent: how long did similar peaks last?"
        "Am I confusing correlation with causation?"
        "Certainty: 60%"
        
Output: 
  Stage: Peak
  Peak Detection: 4/6 conditions met ‚ö†Ô∏è
  Risk Level: High
  Sentiment Score: 7/10 (base) - 2 (peak penalty) = 5/10
  Certainty: 60%
```

**Result:** Distinguishes between different types of peaks.

## Example 3: Fundamentals Analyst

### BEFORE (Old Approach)
```
"Analyze financial statements and earnings calls"
‚Üí Agent produces financial analysis
‚Üí Single summary score

Problem: Couldn't separate:
- Is the company healthy (cost structure)?
- Does the company have competitive advantages (market share)?
- These require different analyses!
```

### AFTER (New Approach with Dual Models)
```
MODEL 2: Cost Structure Analysis
  - Gross margin: 45% (high)
  - Trend: improving (+2%)
  - Cash flow quality: strong
  - Unit economics: LTV/CAC = 5.2 (excellent)
  ‚Üí Cost Structure Score: 7/10
  ‚Üí Meta question: "Is this sustainable or one-time optimization?"
  ‚Üí Answer: Sustainable because market expanding
  ‚Üí Certainty: 75%

MODEL 3: Competitive Landscape
  - Our market share: 22% (+2% YoY)
  - Competitor A: -1%
  - Competitor B: -1%
  - Competitive signal: L2 (our strength recognized)
  ‚Üí Competition Score: 6/10
  ‚Üí Meta question: "Are we gaining share or market expanding?"
  ‚Üí Answer: We're actually gaining relative share
  ‚Üí Certainty: 80%

Output:
  Cost Structure Score: 7/10 (certain 75%)
  Competitive Score: 6/10 (certain 80%)
  (Separate!) Not averaged.
```

**Result:** Two independent assessments for two independent questions.

## Example 4: Bull Researcher

### BEFORE (Old Approach)
```
"Build a strong case emphasizing growth potential..."
‚Üí Agent writes bullish narrative
‚Üí Outputs argument

Problem: Hidden assumption dependencies
- "Revenue will grow 50%" ‚Äî based on what?
- "Market will recognize value" ‚Äî when? how certain?
- Are these assumptions independent or all fail together?
```

### AFTER (New Approach with Assumption Chain)
```
Step 1: EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS
  A1: Business model works ‚Üí 60% confidence
      (Historical precedent: 60% of SaaS startups reach PMF)
      
  A2: Market will grow as projected ‚Üí 70% confidence
      (TAM is $50B, currently $5B, realistic?)
      
  A3: Company achieves profitability ‚Üí 50% confidence
      (Path: reduce CAC 20%, margins improve 15%)
      
  A4: Market recognizes story ‚Üí 40% confidence
      (Need: analyst coverage, customer wins, PR)

Step 2: SYNTHETIC PROBABILITY
  Combined = 0.60 √ó 0.70 √ó 0.50 √ó 0.40 = 8.4%
  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è This is MUCH lower than general bullish sentiment!
  
Step 3: META-COGNITIVE CHECK
  "Am I being realistic or overly optimistic?"
  "Which assumption is most uncertain? A4 (40%)"
  "If A4 fails, does whole case collapse?"
  "Certainty on my assessment: 65%"

Output:
  Assumption 1: 60%
  Assumption 2: 70%
  Assumption 3: 50%
  Assumption 4: 40%
  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
  Combined Probability: 8.4%
  Assumption Chain Strength: 5/10
  Weakest Link: Market Recognition (40%)
  Certainty: 65%
```

**Result:** Bullish case now has explicit, quantified assumptions.

---

## Example 5: Bear Researcher

### BEFORE (Old Approach)
```
"Present arguments against investing..."
‚Üí Agent lists risks
‚Üí Outputs bearish narrative

Problem: No systematic way to question bull assumptions
- Seems like disagreement, but where exactly?
- What probability does bear assign?
- Are they fundamentally opposed or just pessimistic?
```

### AFTER (New Approach with Fragility Analysis)
```
Step 1: EXTRACT BULL'S ASSUMPTIONS
  Bull's A1: 60% ‚Üí Bear assessment: 30%
    Why: Similar startups averaged 30% success, management unproven
    
  Bull's A2: 70% ‚Üí Bear assessment: 40%
    Why: Market may not grow as fast, competitor entries emerging
    
  Bull's A3: 50% ‚Üí Bear assessment: 25%
    Why: Unit economics don't improve as planned in competitive market
    
  Bull's A4: 40% ‚Üí Bear assessment: 15%
    Why: No analyst support yet, not household name, PR is limited

Step 2: BEAR'S SYNTHETIC PROBABILITY
  Combined = 0.30 √ó 0.40 √ó 0.25 √ó 0.15 = 0.45%
  
  vs. Bull's 8.4%
  
Step 3: FRAGILITY ANALYSIS
  Weakest link: A4 (15%)
  "This company needs to be recognized by market, but has no analyst support"
  "This is the breaking point of the entire thesis"
  
Step 4: META-COGNITIVE CHECK
  "Am I too pessimistic? What would change my mind?"
  "If company gets analyst upgrade, I'd reassess A4 to 30%"
  "But currently, fragility is real"
  "Certainty: 70%"

Output:
  Bull's Probability: 8.4%
  Bear's Probability: 0.45%
  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
  Fragility Score: 8/10 (Very fragile)
  Weakest Link: Market Recognition (15%)
  Certainty: 70%
```

**Result:** Bear case now quantified and specific, not just doom-saying.

## The Key Insight

### Old Framework
```
Rule-based ‚Üí One answer
    ‚Üì
"If 6+ indicators agree ‚Üí BUY signal"
    ‚Üì
But ignores: valuation, fundamentals, sentiment, competition
```

### New Framework
```
Principle-based + Context ‚Üí Nuanced answer
    ‚îú‚îÄ Signal says BULLISH
    ‚îú‚îÄ Context says CAUTIOUS (high valuation)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Sentiment says EXTREME (peak detected)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Fundamentals say MODERATE (margin pressure)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Competition says WEAK (new entrant)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ ‚Üí CONFLICTING SIGNALS
        ‚Üí Need meta-thinking to reconcile
        ‚Üí Agent explains tradeoffs
        ‚Üí Humans can evaluate for themselves
```

---

## The Meta-Cognitive Layer

**Core idea:** Every agent now asks itself:

```
1. What am I assuming?
2. Am I seeing all angles?
3. How certain am I really?
4. What's my biggest blind spot?
5. Under what conditions would I be wrong?
```

This prevents:
- ‚ùå Overconfidence ("I'm always right because my framework is right")
- ‚ùå Hidden biases ("I didn't notice I was ignoring this")
- ‚ùå Brittle analysis ("This breaks if X changes")
- ‚ùå Dogmatism ("Rules must be followed")

And enables:
- ‚úÖ Principled skepticism ("I doubt this, and here's why")
- ‚úÖ Humble confidence ("I'm 75% sure, not 100%")
- ‚úÖ Adaptability ("If this changes, my whole case changes")
- ‚úÖ Transparency ("Here's my reasoning")

---

## Comparing Certainty Levels

### Old System
```
Agent: "Market signal is strong ‚Üí Score 8/10"
Human: "But how sure are you?"
Agent: "Uh... I don't know? I just applied the rule?"
```

### New System
```
Agent: "Market signal is strong (7/10 base)"
       "Context support adds value (context +1)"
       "But valuation is extreme (risk -1)"
       "Final score: 7/10"
       "My certainty: 65%"
       "If competition surprises, score drops to 4/10"
Human: "OK, now I understand your confidence level"
```

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Framework Type** | Rules | Principles + Rules |
| **Assumption Visibility** | Hidden | Explicit |
| **Probability Quantification** | No | Yes (MODEL 5) |

## Result

Instead of 5 rigid agents following formulas, we now have:

**5 thinking partners** who:
- Acknowledge their assumptions
- Question themselves
- State their certainty level
- Explain their reasoning
- Admit where they could be wrong
- Work with humans, not instead of them

This is **meta-cognition in prompting** ‚Äî not just analyzing the market, but analyzing how we analyze the market.
