## Meta-Cognitive Framework

All agents now include explicit meta-cognitive questioning:

### Common Framework
```
Step N: Meta-Cognitive Check

Q1: How objective am I really being?
   - Am I seeking supporting evidence or truth?
   - Can I name counterarguments?

Q2: What's my biggest blind spot?
   - What assumption am I most uncertain about?
   - Where would skeptics push hardest?

Q3: Who would disagree with me?
   - What specific data would convince them?
   - Is my logic actually sound?

Q4: What would change my mind?
   - What specific evidence would flip my thesis?
   - Am I actually open to being wrong?

Q5: Certainty Level [30% / 60% / 75% / 90%]
   - How confident am I really?
   - Adjust score if certainty < 60%
```

## Key Improvements Over Original

### Before
- ❌ Implicit reasoning (models not named)
- ❌ Rules-based approach (rigid steps)
- ❌ Chinese prompts (team confusion)
- ❌ No self-awareness (blind spots unaddressed)
- ❌ Point scores (no uncertainty tracking)

### After
- ✅ Explicit mental models (MODEL 1-5 named)
- ✅ Principle-based approach (flexible framework)
- ✅ English prompts (consistent, clear)
- ✅ Self-aware agents (meta-cognitive layers)
- ✅ Uncertainty tracking (30/60/75/90% levels)
- ✅ Transparent reasoning (traceable logic)
- ✅ Synthetic probability (product method)
- ✅ Fragility analysis (weakest links)

---

## Business Impact

### Decision Quality Improvements Expected
- **More Transparent**: Reasoning is explicit and traceable
- **More Honest**: Agents identify their own blind spots
- **More Conservative**: Fragility scores capture real risk
- **More Calibrated**: Certainty levels track confidence
- **More Systematic**: Mental models provide framework

### Risk Reduction
- Fragility analysis identifies vulnerable theses early
- Weakest link methodology prevents "everything fails together" scenarios
- Meta-cognitive checks reduce overconfidence
- Certainty levels allow risk-weighted decisions

### Operational Benefits
- Easier debugging (clear reasoning steps)
- Better collaboration (English, explicit models)
- Simpler testing (each step verifiable)
- Maintainability (well-documented, modular)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Discovery Process**: PhilosophicalResearcher almost missed - check for advanced implementations
2. **JSON vs Text**: Different output formats require flexible parsing
3. **Worldview Integration**: Preserved advanced features while improving prompts
4. **Meta-Cognition**: Can be implemented explicitly without breaking existing logic
5. **Mental Models**: Naming them makes them actionable

---

## Recommendations

1. **Run Tests First**: Before deploying, validate with sample tickers
2. **Update Risk Manager**: New fields require new parsing logic
3. **Compare Outputs**: A/B test basic vs advanced implementations
4. **Track Metrics**: Monitor win rate, certainty calibration, fragility accuracy
5. **Iterate**: Use performance data to refine prompts further
